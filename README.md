This project is an automated attendance system built using an Arduino UNO and the R307
fingerprint sensor module. The system supports fingerprint enrollment and authentication
to accurately record attendance. A Python script processes the authenticated entries and
logs the attendance data into a Microsoft Excel sheet, enabling organized and reliable
record-keeping.
